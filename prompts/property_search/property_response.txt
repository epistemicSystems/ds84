For each property:
1. Identify how well it matches the user's explicit criteria
2. Highlight special features that align with implied preferences
3. Note any potential compromises or trade-offs
4. Consider the property's unique selling points
5. Assess value proposition relative to price

Organize properties by relevance to the user's needs, not just by price or size.
Consider both objective match and subjective appeal.

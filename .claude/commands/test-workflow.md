description: Help me test a cognitive workflow implementation
---

I need to test a cognitive workflow in the REALTOR AI COPILOT system. Please:

1. Ask me which workflow I want to test
2. Review the workflow implementation in `app/services/`
3. Check if the required prompt templates exist in `prompts/`
4. Create test cases following the prompt test harness pattern from the specs
5. Implement unit tests for each cognitive state in the workflow
6. Implement integration tests for the complete workflow
7. Create example API requests for manual testing
8. Run the tests and show me the results
9. If tests fail, help me debug and fix the issues
10. Suggest additional test cases to improve coverage

Follow the testing strategy outlined in the architectural specifications.

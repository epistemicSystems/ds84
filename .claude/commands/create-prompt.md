description: Help me create a new prompt template following best practices
---

I need to create a new prompt template for the REALTOR AI COPILOT system. Please:

1. Ask me what the prompt is for (e.g., intent analysis, property search, agent analysis)
2. Ask me which cognitive function it serves (perception, reasoning, generation, evaluation)
3. Review the prompt engineering patterns in `cognitive-workflow-prompts.md`
4. Create a structured prompt following the meta-prompting patterns:
   - <cognitive_function> block defining the agent's role
   - <context> block for relevant context
   - <input> block for structured input
   - <reasoning> block with step-by-step instructions
   - <output_format> block with schema specification
5. Save the prompt template in the appropriate directory under `prompts/`
6. Show me how to register and use this prompt in the workflow service
7. Suggest test cases for evaluating the prompt's performance

Follow the cognitive workflow architecture and prompt engineering principles documented in the specs.

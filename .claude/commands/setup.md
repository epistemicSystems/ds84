description: Guide me through setting up the REALTOR AI COPILOT development environment
---

I need help setting up the REALTOR AI COPILOT development environment. Please:

1. Check if Docker is installed and running
2. Check if Python 3.10+ is installed
3. Create the Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist
4. Install all required dependencies from requirements.txt (create it if it doesn't exist)
5. Create the .env file with placeholder values if it doesn't exist
6. Set up the PostgreSQL and pgvector databases using docker-compose
7. Verify the setup by running a health check

Walk me through each step and show me what you're doing. If any step fails, help me troubleshoot the issue.

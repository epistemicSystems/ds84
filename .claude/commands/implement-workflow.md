description: Help me implement a new cognitive workflow following the architecture spec
---

I want to implement a new cognitive workflow for the REALTOR AI COPILOT system. Please help me:

1. First, ask me which workflow I want to implement (e.g., property search, agent analysis, content generation)
2. Review the cognitive workflow architecture in `realtor-ai-workflow.md`
3. Review the progressive implementation strategy in `progressive-implementation.md`
4. Ask me which implementation level I want to target (Level 1-4)
5. Create the workflow implementation following the architectural patterns
6. Create the necessary prompt templates in the `prompts/` directory
7. Implement the workflow service in `app/services/`
8. Create the API endpoint in `app/api/`
9. Write tests for the workflow
10. Show me how to test the implementation

Follow the established coding patterns and architectural principles documented in the project specs.

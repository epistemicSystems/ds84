### VALUE PROPOSITION
Realtor AI Copilot transforms the traditional real estate agent workflow by leveraging advanced language models to provide deep property analysis, competitive agent intelligence, and natural language search capabilities that far exceed current MLS limitations.

### KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

3. **Phase 3**: AI-powered content generation for marketing materials

### STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
